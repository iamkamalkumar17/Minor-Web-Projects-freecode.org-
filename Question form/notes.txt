META:
    You may be familiar with the meta element already;
    it is used to specify information about the page, such as the title, description, keywords, and author.

    Give your page a meta element with an appropriate charset value.

    The charset attribute specifies the character encoding of the page, and, nowadays
    , UTF-8 is the only encoding supported by most browsers.

    Continuing with the meta elements, a viewport definition tells the browser how to render the page. 
    Including one betters visual accessibility on mobile, and improves SEO (search engine optimization).

    Add a viewport definition with a content attribute detailing the width and initial-scale of the page.
    Another important meta element for accessibility and SEO is the description definition. 
    The value of the content attribute is used by search engines to provide a description of your page.

    Add a meta element with the name attribute set to description, and give it a useful content attribute.
    Lastly in the head, the title element is useful for screen readers to understand the content of a page. 
    Furthermore, it is an important part of SEO.

    Give your page a title that is descriptive and concise.


BODY:
    The header element will be used to introduce the page, as well as provide a navigation menu.

     The main element will contain the core content of your page.
